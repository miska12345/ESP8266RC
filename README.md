Welcome\! This repository contains the source code for:

  - NodeMCU Software
  - ESP8266 RC

# NodeMCU Software Overview

Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:

## NodeMCU Software

NodeMCU software is a simple remote control application for the ESP8266 module. It supports both Connect by IP and Scan Nearby and uses Socket for remote communication.

The application has not been tested for memory footage, security vulnerbility, and other runtime exceptions.

## Arduino code

The remote_control.ino file contain source code for the ESP8266 RC car.

# Getting Started
