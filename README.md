Welcome\! This repository contains the source code for:

  - NodeMCU Software
  - ESP8266 RC
  - Android APP

# NodeMCU Software Overview

Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:

## NodeMCU Software

NodeMCU software is a simple remote control application for the ESP8266 module. It supports both Connect by IP and Scan Nearby and uses Socket for remote communication.

Be aware: The application has not been tested for memory footage, security vulnerbility, and other runtime exceptions.

## Arduino code

The remote_control.ino file contain source code for the ESP8266 RC car.

## Android App

The app is provided as a reference for how similar ideas can be applied for Android app development.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* You must be running Windows 1903 (build >= 10.0.18362.0) or above in order to run NodeMCU Software
  - **As of May 2019** this build is only available through Windows Insider Program. You may register and configure Insider Program through your device's system settings.
* You will need at least [VS 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed
* You will need Arduino IDE for compilation and uploading Arduino code
* You will need Android Studio for the Android app
